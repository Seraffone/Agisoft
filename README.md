# Agisoft
Various scripts for Agisoft automation. Works with both Photoscan and Metashape, though the latter may raise some non-fatal errors when run.

<b>AlignPhotos.py:</b> Runs the Align Photos function normally found under Workflow. Users must first upload the photos they desire to align, then go to Tools > Run Script and select ALignPhotos.py.
